# A=2,b=”2”.Sum=a+b. Guess the output also find the reason for the same?

#Ans:
# The simple programs so far have followed a basic programming pattern: input-calculate-output. Get all the data first,
# calculate with it second, and output the results last. The pattern sequence would be even clearer if we explicitly
# create a named result variable in the middle.
